# Masters-Research-Project

The masters research project was an extensive tolerance analysis of a fourier transform spectrometer prototype which was considered for the ORIGIN mission. Components of the project included tolerance simulations of the setup on Zemax, analysis of stability with a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), calibration of Point to Collimators (P2C) for the photomixer setup and extensive frequency scans of the stage performance.

This repository includes codes made that were necessary for data handling or instrumentation automation or calibration. Such codes include:
- CMM data handling,
- P2C tuning and testing with Non-Linear Least Squares Method,
- Photomixer performance,
- FTS stage command and laser scanner.
